		<p><strong>MANILA</strong> – The Philippines has updated the testing and
			quarantine protocols for international travelers coming from the “green”
			and “yellow” lists of countries, territories, and jurisdictions.</p>

		<p>The revised guidelines were contained in Resolution 142 approved on
			Thursday by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging
			Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID), Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque
			said in a press statement.</p>

		<p>Roque, also acting as IATF-EID spokesperson, said the latest testing
			and quarantine protocols take effect on Friday.</p>

		<p>Under the new rules, fully-vaccinated individuals from “green” or
			“yellow” states need to undergo facility-based quarantine until the
			release of the negative result of their reverse transcription-polymerase
			chain reaction (RT-PCR) test taken on their fifth day in the country.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals, as well
			as those with unverified vaccination status are required to undergo
			facility-based quarantine until the release of the negative result
			of their RT-PCR test taken on their seventh day in the country,
			Roque said.</p>

		<p><strong>MANILA</strong> – The Department of Health on Thursday urged the public to remain
			vigilant as the number of COVID-19 infections in the Philippines dropped. </p>

		<p>The country on Wednesday reported 9,868 fresh COVID-19 cases, the second straight day
			that the number of new infections was below 10,000. The lower case count was due to lower
			laboratory output last Monday, the DOH said.</p>

		<p>The agency had "identified and analyzed" all factors such as lower laboratory outputs,
			a decrease in test outputs resulting in lower positivity rate and fewer hospital
			admissions, said DOH spokesperson Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire.</p>

		<p>"With all of these factors validated at napag-aralan, we are confirming
			cases are declining pero hindi po ito senyales para tayo ay maging complacent,"
			she said in a virtual public briefing.</p>

		<p>(With all of these factors validated at and studied, we are confirming cases
			are declining but it's not a sign to be complacent.)</p>

		<p>"Alalahanin po natin na bagamat bumababa ang mga kaso,
			ang atin pong mga ospital ay meron pa rin pong pagkapuno."</p>

		<p>(Let's be reminded that although case shave declines,
			our hospitals remain somewhat full.)</p>
